## Starfish Keywords
# These keywords are necessary to exist in the config.yaml (to enable Starfish to run)
# but are not used by and have no affect on Eniric and the loading of the phoenix spectral libraries.
# As such they are all set to nothing.
#
# To configure the path to the phoenix libraries use
#    paths:
#        phoenix_raw:
#        btsettl_raw:
# above.
# If you are wanting to use "Eniric" with the other features "Starfish" good luck!
# (or open an issue github issue).
