  abstract = {High-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements have been central in 
the study of exoplanets during the last two decades, from the early
discovery of hot Jupiters, to the recent mass measurements of
Earth-sized planets uncovered by transit surveys. While optical RV is
now a mature field, there is currently a strong effort to push the
technique into the near-infrared domain (chiefly Y, J, H, and K
bandpasses) to probe planetary systems around late-type stars. The
combined lower mass and luminosity of M dwarfs leads to an increased
reflex RV signal for planets in the habitable zone compared to Sun-like
stars. The estimates on the detectability of planets rely on various
instrumental characteristics but also on a prior knowledge of the
stellar spectrum. While the overall properties of M dwarf spectra have
been extensively tested against observations, the same is not true for
their detailed line profiles, which leads to significant uncertainties
when converting a given signal-to-noise ratio to a corresponding RV
precision as attainable on a given spectrograph. By combining archival
CRIRES and HARPS data with ESPaDOnS data of Barnard's star, we
show that state-of-the-art atmosphere models over-predict the Y- and
J-band RV content by more than a factor of $\sim$2, while
under-predicting the H- and K-band content by half.},
