  abstract = {We present new models for low-mass stars down to the hydrogen-burning limit that consistently couple atmosphere and interior structures, thereby superseding the widely used BCAH98 models. The new models include updated molecular linelists and solar abundances, as well as atmospheric convection parameters calibrated on 2D/3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations. Comparison of these models with observations in various colour-magnitude diagrams for various ages shows significant improvement over previous generations of models. The new models can solve flaws that are present in the previous ones, such as the prediction of optical colours that are too blue compared to M dwarf observations. They can also reproduce the four components of the young quadruple system LkCa 3 in a colour-magnitude diagram with one single isochrone, in contrast to any presently existing model. In this paper we also highlight the need for consistency when comparing models and observations, with the necessity of using evolutionary models and colours based on the same atmospheric structures.},

  doi = {10/gfdcsp},
  abstract = {We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line "outliers." By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high resolution \$V\$-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate resolution \$K\$-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.},

  abstract = {Two distinct but fully compatible novel concepts are proposed here for solar/stellar velocity measurements. The first is that of absolute accelerometry proper. This involves two simultaneously, operating servo-control loops First, a variable path-difference Fabry-Perot interferometer is adjusted so that its bandpasses track the fluctuations of either a single spectral line (in the solar case, leading to the solar accelerometer), or of all lines simultaneously (stellar accelerometer). The second loop involves a tunable laser tracking one of the FP bandpasses. The net overall result is that a laser line tracks the stellar/solar ones: the problem of measuring Doppler-shift changes has been transferred from the incoherent to the coherent optics domain. One then measures the beat frequency generated by mixing the tunable laser beam with that of stabilized laser. Only velocity changes are accessible; the devices are true accelerometers, but absolute ones. All instrumental or spectral characteristics drop out; no calibration of any kind is required; hence, one may hope for an unusually low level of systematic errors.},

  abstract = {The CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to
search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey
sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These
spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a resolution of at
least R $>$80 000, and we measure its RV, H$\alpha$ emission, and
projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution
M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To
quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over
the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on
the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our
high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine
the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and signal-to-noise ratio.
We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be
reached in the wavelength range 700-900 nm. Observations at longer
wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types
(M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large
amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of
an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s-1 in very low
mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m
class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a
red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for
low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar
variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has
the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter
level of 3-4 m s-1.},

the study of exoplanets during the last two decades, from the early
discovery of hot Jupiters, to the recent mass measurements of
Earth-sized planets uncovered by transit surveys. While optical RV is
now a mature field, there is currently a strong effort to push the
technique into the near-infrared domain (chiefly Y, J, H, and K
bandpasses) to probe planetary systems around late-type stars. The
combined lower mass and luminosity of M dwarfs leads to an increased
reflex RV signal for planets in the habitable zone compared to Sun-like
stars. The estimates on the detectability of planets rely on various
instrumental characteristics but also on a prior knowledge of the
stellar spectrum. While the overall properties of M dwarf spectra have
been extensively tested against observations, the same is not true for
their detailed line profiles, which leads to significant uncertainties
when converting a given signal-to-noise ratio to a corresponding RV
precision as attainable on a given spectrograph. By combining archival
CRIRES and HARPS data with ESPaDOnS data of Barnard's star, we
show that state-of-the-art atmosphere models over-predict the Y- and
J-band RV content by more than a factor of $\sim$2, while
under-predicting the H- and K-band content by half.},

The spectrograph will be installed at the Combined-Coud\'e Laboratory of the VLT and linked to the four 8.2 m Unit Telescopes (UT) through four optical Coud\'e trains. ESPRESSO will combine efficiency and extreme spectroscopic precision. ESPRESSO is foreseen to achieve a gain of two magnitudes with respect to its predecessor HARPS, and to improve the instrumental radial-velocity precision to reach the 10 cm s\textsuperscript{-1} level. It can be operated either with a single UT or with up to four UTs, enabling an additional gain in the latter mode. The incoherent combination of four telescopes and the extreme precision requirements called for many innovative design solutions while ensuring the technical heritage of the successful HARPS experience. ESPRESSO will allow to explore new frontiers in most domains of astrophysics that require precision and sensitivity. The main scientific drivers are the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zone of quiet, nearby G to M-dwarfs and the analysis of the variability of fundamental physical constants. The project passed the final design review in May 2013 and entered the manufacturing phase.
