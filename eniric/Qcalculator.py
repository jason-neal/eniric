    Parameters
    ----------

    From Eq. (11) and (12) of
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07468v1.pdf#cite.2001A%26A...374..733B
    it follows that the RV uncertainty associated with the information content
    of a given spectra is given by

        RV_rms = c /(Q *Sum{Ne}) = c / (sqrt{sum{W(i)}})

    in which c is the speed of light in vacuum, Q the quality factor of a
    spectrum, and N_e the total number of photoelectrons collected inside the
    wavelength range of interest. However, the precision can only be calculated
    using the concept of optimal pixel weight W(i) for each of the pixels i
    that compose the spectra.

        W(i) = lambda(i)**2 (d'A_0(i) / d'lambda(i))**2 / (A_0(i) + sigma_D**2)

    in which lambda(i) and A_0(i) are the values of each pixel wave-length and
    flux, respectively. The weight will be proportional to the information
    content of the spectrum, given by the derivative of the amplitude, and
    calculated following Connes (1985).
    The denominator of the previous equation is the variance of the flux of
    the pixel A_0(i), depending on the flux value itself and on the
    detector noise sigma_D. In this paper we exclusively consider the high
    signal-to-noise ratio regime, so we can approximate A_0(i) + sigma_D**2
    to A_0(i).
