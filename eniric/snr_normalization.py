"""
The theoretical RV precision (only due to photon noise) is
inversely dependent on the spectral flux.
That is as the flux increases the error on the RV measurement decreases.

The flux of a observed spectra is dependant on a number of
factors e.g.
    * Star luminosity
    * Integration time
    * Telescope area
    * Instrument efficiency

The photon flux can be scaled by multiplicative constant which
affects the photon SNR and the radial velocity precision.

To compare the relative theoretical precision between different
synthetic spectra they are normalized consistently.

This is achieved by normalizing to a specific SNR per
resolution element at a particular location.

By default this is a SNR of 100 at the center of the "J" band.
Other band centers or wavelengths as well as other SNR values
can be chosen.

The following functions are used to determine the normalization
constant to divide a spectrum by to achieve the desired
normalization.
