`Eniric` is a Python 3 software to compute the theoretical Radial Velocity (RV) precision of stellar spectra.
`Eniric` is an overhaul and extension to the code used in [Figueria et al. 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526900) to analysis the precision of M-dwarf stars.
Extending the performance and usability, it is able to be used on any synthetic spectra from the [PHOENIX-ACES](http://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de) and [BT-Settl](https://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/BT-Settl/CIFIST2011_2015/FITS/) (CIFIST2001-2015) libraries.

## Features:
`Eniric` contains a number of features to transform and prepare the spectra (observed and synthetic).

- [Spectral broadening](https://eniric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/broadening.html)

     Allows for Rotational and Instrumental broadening of synthetic spectra given a rotation speed ``vsini`` and resolution ``R``.

- [Atmospheric transmission masking](https://eniric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/telluric_corection.html)

   Analyzing the RV precision attainable under the different masking conditions presented in `Figueira et al. 2016`_.

   The three conditions specifically treated are:
   * No contamination or treatment of atmospheric transmission
   * Masking all regions affected by atmospheric absorption of a given depth % over the course of the year.
   * Assuming perfect telluric correction in which the variance of the measured flux is impacted.

- Relative RV precision

  The RV precision can be calculated relative to a specified SNR per pixel in the center of a spectroscopic band.
    The default as used in the Figueira et al. 2016 is a SNR of 100 at the center of the J-band.

- Spectral Resampling

   Allows for resampling of synthetic spectra to ``N`` pixels per FWHM.

- SNR normalization.

   Normalize spectral flux to a defined SNR level.

- Band selection

  Analysis splitable into individual photometric bands ``Z``\ , ``Y``\ , ``J``\ , ``H``\ , ``K``.
  User definable.

- Theoretical RV precision

   Compute spectral RV precision and spectral quality.

- Incremental quality & precision

    Determine the RV precision and spectral quality on narrow wavelength slices across the entire spectrum, similar to that present in Figure 1 of `Artigau et al. 2018 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..198A>`_.

* Analyse relative precision of synthetic libraries

    The RV precision of are present relative to a specified SNR per pixel in the center of a photometric band.
    The default as used in `Figueira et al. 2016`_ is a SNR of 100 at the center of the J-band.

## Background
The origin of this code was used in [Figueira et al. 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526900).

    P. Figueira, V. Zh. Adibekyan, M. Oshagh, J. J. Neal, B. Rojas-Ayala, C. Lovis, C. Melo, F. Pepe, N. C. Santos, M. Tsantaki, 2016,
    Radial velocity information content of M dwarf spectra in the near-infrared,
    Astronomy and Astrophysics, 586, A101

It had a number of efficiency issues with convolution which were improved upon
