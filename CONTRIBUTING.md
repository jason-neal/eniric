  &nbsp; maybe check if the bug was not already reported (and solved) by searching the closed issues.

* If possible, use the bug report template to create the issue.


#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
* Did you run the tests locally/do they pass? You can use `make test` from the root directory.

#### Coding conventions
The style guide for eniric is governed by [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) wth default settings. 
You can run this yourself but it is also included in the pre-commit hooks. 

Before commiting changes you can activate the [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) using    

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    
This will then preform the pre-commit checks before commiting.


Thank you!
